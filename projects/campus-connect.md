# 1️⃣ ONE-PAGE PROJECT OVERVIEW

## 🏫 Project Name
**Campus Connect**

## 🎯 Vision
Create a single digital home for students — combining academics, engagement, convenience, and career opportunities into one accessible platform.

## 🧩 The Problem
University life is chaotic because information is scattered across:
- Telegram channels  
- Paper announcements  
- WhatsApp groups  
- Random websites  
- Students who “heard something somewhere”  

This leads to:
- Missed events  
- Difficulty finding resources  
- No easy way to find study or project partners  
- No platform for clubs to communicate  
- No centralized job board  
- Zero campus-wide community engagement  

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A mobile-friendly web platform that includes:
- Academic resources + calendar  
- Social feed for confessions, questions, talks  
- Clubs + events hub  
- Study buddy and project buddy matching  
- Lost & found board  
- Jobs/internships listing  
- Profiles with points, skills, mood bar  
- Admin announcements  
- Marketplace + gallery in future updates  

## 👥 Target Users
- Students (primary)  
- Club leaders  
- Campus admin  
- Alumni (future)  
- Local businesses (future integrations)  

## 🌟 Core Value Propositions
- Centralize important student information  
- Increase campus engagement and interaction  
- Provide academic and career tools  
- Build a community that feels alive  
- Reduce the noise & confusion of campus communications  

## 📏 Success Metrics (MVP)
- **500+ weekly active users**  
- **10+ daily posts** in community feed  
- **5+ events** created weekly
